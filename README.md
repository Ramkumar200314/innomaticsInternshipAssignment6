Movie Search App

A JavaScript project that allows users to search for movies using a movie database API and perform actions like adding movies to a favorites list, rating, and reviewing them. The app also supports pagination and persistent data using localStorage.

Features

Search for Movies: Users can search for movies by title using the OMDB or TMDB API.

Display Movie Details: Each movie result displays the title, genre, rating, description, and poster.

Favorites List: Users can add movies to a favorites list, stored in localStorage for persistence.

Rate and Review Movies: Users can rate and leave reviews for movies, which are also saved in localStorage.

Data Persistence: Movie favorites, ratings, and reviews are saved using localStorage, so they remain available after the browser is closed.
